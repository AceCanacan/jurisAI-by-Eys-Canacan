## 📖 Project Description

JurisAI is transforming the legal consultation process. Before a lawyer even meets their client, they can have a detailed understanding of the client's legal concerns. Through a chatbot conversation, clients provide in-depth information about their case, which is then analyzed and can be relayed to the lawyer. This ensures that even before the actual consultation, lawyers have a foundational understanding of the client's needs.

**🛠 Technologies Used:**
- React Native
- OpenAI API

**🚧 Challenges Faced:**
- Navigating the intricacies of the OpenAI API, especially prompt engineering.

**🔜 Future Improvements:**
- Integration of an LLM (Language Model) specifically tailored for the legal field to enhance accuracy and relevance.

## 🔧 Installation

1. 📥 Ensure all prerequisites required by React Native are installed.
2. 🔑 Obtain a key for the OpenAI API.
3. 📦 Install OpenAI.

## 🚀 Usage

Post-installation, users can interact with the chatbot. After the chat, an analysis is provided, which can then be sent to the lawyer, giving them a preliminary understanding of the client's legal concerns.

## ✨ Features

- **📋 Client-Chatbot Interaction:** 
  * **Gathering Information:** The chatbot engages with the client to gather detailed information about their legal concerns.
  * **Analysis:** Post-conversation, an in-depth analysis is generated.
  * **Relaying to Lawyers:** The analysis can be sent to lawyers, ensuring they're informed even before the actual consultation.
